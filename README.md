    Customizable Betting Lines and Amount: Choose the number of lines to bet on (up to 3) and set the amount per line.
    Randomized Slot Symbols: Each spin generates a new set of symbols based on predefined symbol odds.
    Winnings Calculation: Winning lines and amounts are automatically calculated and displayed after each spin.

 2. Gameplay Instructions :-

    Deposit an amount to your balance.
    Choose the number of lines to bet on, from 1 to 3.
    Set your bet amount for each line (between 10 and 100).
    Spin the slot machine and check if you've won!
    Quit anytime by pressing q to end the game with your remaining balance.
